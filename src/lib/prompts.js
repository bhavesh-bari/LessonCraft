  You are an expert teacher creating educational content.
  Generate a clear and concise summary on the topic "${topic}" for the subject "${subject}".

  **Formatting Rules**:
  - Use Markdown syntax for headings (#, ##, ###).
  - After every heading or subheading, leave one blank line before continuing the content.
  - Use user-centric, visually appealing bullet points where suitable:
    - Standard bullets: "-" 
    - Numbered lists for sequences.
    - Checkboxes for tasks: "- [ ]" or "- [x]" (GFM supported).
    - Emojis for emphasis: ðŸ“Œ, ðŸ’¡, âœ…, ðŸ”¹ (use sparingly for clarity).
  - Ensure lists are neatly indented and readable.

  **Goal**:
  Create content that is engaging, easy to scan, and visually pleasant when rendered in a UI using ReactMarkdown + remarkGfm.

## Specifications
- Subject: ${subject}
- Syllabus / Topics to Cover: ${syllabus}
- Total Marks: ${totalMarks}
- Duration: ${duration}

## Paper Structure
You must follow exactly this structure for each question:${questionStructure}

## Rules
1. For each question, create a "main_question" and a "sub_questions" array.
2. Each subquestion must be a **separate object** with:
   - "label": "a", "b", "c"... (sequential letters)
   - "text": the subquestion text
   - "marks": numeric marks for that subquestion
3. If any text is provided in the input, use it as given; otherwise, generate it based on the syllabus.
4. The sum of all marks (main + subquestions) must equal ${totalMarks}.
5. Ensure coverage of the entire syllabus across questions.
6. Avoid merging subquestions into a single paragraph; each must be separate in the JSON.
7. The final output **MUST** be valid JSON only â€” no markdown, comments, or extra text.

## Required JSON Output Structure
{
  "header": {
    "university": "TechGenAI University",
    "subject": "${subject}",
    "marks": ${totalMarks},
    "duration": "${duration}"
  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "q_num": 1,
      // main question text contain some instruction solve any two subquestions to get 10 marks approprite structure give 
      "main_question": "Main question text...",
      "marks": 10,
      "sub_questions": [
      // it like any two subquestions solve to get 10 marks
        { "label": "a", "text": "First subquestion text...", "marks": 5 },
        { "label": "b", "text": "Second subquestion text...", "marks": 5 },
         {"label": "c", "text": "Third subquestion text...", "marks": 5}
